      <h4>Story</h4>
      <div class="section">
        <div class="text">
          <p>It’s a sunny day on Earth in some neighborhood where old people go. The Cat sits in a quaint, brick house doing cat things such as meowing and sleeping. The Grandma lays in front of the window as she soaks in the sun. Just what you would expect in the normal routine of a single Grandma and her furry friend.</p>
          <p>Then…disaster strikes!</p>
          <p>Death appears in the house through his Death Portal. He’s on a mission...to collect the soul of Grandma! Death is simply on the job and it looks like Grandma’s living days are up. He raises his hand to fire his Death Soul Collecting Beam at his unfortunate victim.</p>
          <p>But suddenly, the Cat jumps in front of the beam. His whole life flashes before his eyes. His most cherished memories all include the Grandma. She gave him a home. She taught him love. She taught him patience. And he’ll experience all the pain to save her. The body of a housecat is not built to survive the brunt of this death ray. The soul leaves the Cat and his eyes turn lifeless.</p>
          <p>Death wasn’t expecting this act of feline bravery and he has a soft spot for our furry friends. After all, he’s only in charge of taking human souls. Touched by this brave act and upset at himself for his careless mistake, Death returns the poor soul and adds something a little extra. Upon receiving his soul back, the Cat’s fur turns jet black and he opens his eyes. There’s something in him that has changed.</p>
          <p>Death has the Grandma in his clutches but he has not yet robbed her of her soul. He hints to the Cat that there’s a chance he can delay his owner’s death day. He merely has to follow Death into the deepest pits of Hell. It’s impossible for the normal everyday housecat, but the Cat has been enchanted with Death’s blessing. He can switch between the two worlds at will. He can also walk on just two legs now, surprisingly. Rejuvenated and determined, the Cat pursues the robed, merciful kidnapper.</p>

      <h4>Characters</h4>
      <div class="section">
        <div class="large-text">
          <h5>The Cat</h5>
          <p>The character you play and the protagonist of our story. He has a heart of gold and would do anything to save his owner, even if it means traversing outlandish hellscapes. He’s pretty much a normal cat, except that he can warp between Earth and Hell at will. When he isn’t dodging hellbeasts, he enjoys playing with yarn and climbing on things.</p>

          <h5>The Grandma</h5>
          <p>She’s the owner of our adorable protagonist and loves to smile. Today’s also her death day and Death is never tardy on his soul collections. Besides this, not much is known is known about this mysterious, sweet old woman. Despite being called “Grandma” by her local community, she hasn’t been seen with any grandchildren nor has it been confirmed that she has had (human) children herself.</p>

          <h5>Death</h5>
          <p>The ruler of hell. The prince of darkness. The Omega. The “Soul Harvester.” Garbed in a tattered black hood, he reaps the souls of any mortal whose time is up. Despite his ice cold demeanor, he has a soft spot for cute kitties, specifically our protagonist. He’s willing to give any adorable cat a second chance.</p>
